## PDB statistics 

Here we inspect the types of structures in the main database for 30 biomolecular data - the PDB. 

>Q1: Determine the percentage of structures solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy. 

```{r}
# read in file 
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)

# calculate percentage values asked for 

answer <- stats$Total / sum(stats$Total) * 100
names(answer) <- rownames(stats)
round(answer, 2)

```


>Q1.5 Also can you determine what proportion of structures are protein? Aim to have a rendered GitHub document with working code that yields your answers.

```{r}
sum(stats$Proteins) / sum(stats$Total) * 100
```


>Q2: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many
HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?
